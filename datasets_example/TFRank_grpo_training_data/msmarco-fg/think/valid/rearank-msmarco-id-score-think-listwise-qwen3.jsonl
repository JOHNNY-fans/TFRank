However, the practical number of usable open ports depends on the router's resources (memory, CPU) and the network configuration. Most home routers will not be able to handle that many concurrent connections.\n[2] The terms \"open port\" and \"forwarded port\" can be confusing. Port forwarding opens a specific port to the internet, allowing traffic to bypass the router's firewall and reach a specific device on your network. This is different from simply having ports available for internal network communication.\n[3] Know Your Network, Lesson 1: Router Hardware 101 Most routers have one WAN port, but you'll need as many LAN ports as you have wired devices. If you have more wired devices than can fit on a router, you can plug them all in using a wired switch. A switch is like a power strip for your router: it lets you plug in more devices than the router originally allowed.our router is the glue that holds your home network together. It connects all your computers to one another, either through Ethernet cables or a wireless connection. A router is different than a modem: your modem connects you to the internet, while your router connects your computers to one another.\n[4] Port forwarding is a technique that allows external devices to connect to a computer on a private network. This can be useful for hosting servers or accessing devices remotely.\n[5] Home routers typically use NAT (Network Address Translation), which means that all devices on the internal network share a single public IP address. When a device on the internal network makes a request to the internet, the router assigns it a random high-numbered port (above 1024) for the return traffic. These ports are temporarily opened and closed as needed.\n[6] Hi, how many 'ports' does a router have? There is typically 4 ports built into home routers. If you need more ports for more computers you can buy a switch for cheap. By default, a home router can usually assigns from 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.254. So by default you can have up to 154 users between wired and wireless users.\n[7] Most routers have a default range of ports that are open for common services like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and DNS (port 53). The actual number of open ports can vary depending on the router's configuration and security settings. While technically 65535 ports exist, the router's firmware, firewall and configuration will dictate how many are actually 'open' and available for use.\n[8] A firewall protects a network by blocking unauthorized access to specific ports. While a router comes with a built-in firewall, users can configure firewall rules to control which ports are open and closed for different types of traffic.\n[9] A computer virus is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be \"infected\" with a computer virus.\n[10] What Are Printer Ports? Software ports are ports on a computer that act as the middleman between the computer and an external device. They act as keys that printers use to interact with computers. There are 65,535 different ports a computer can use, and of that amount the most common printing ports are 9100 and 6001.\n /think"}], "solution": "[1](4) = [6](4) > [5](3) = [7](3) > [2](2) = [8](2) > [3](1) = [4](1) > [9](0) = [10](0)"}

Energy is all defined as the ability to push or pull by exertion in a certain path or distance. Energy is also measured in joules. Energy and work are said to be scalar units. “Scalar” means it does not have any direction.\n[2] Work-Energy Principle If a moving object is stopped by a collision, extending the stopping distance will reduce the average impact force. The rate of doing work is equal to the rate of using energy since the a force transfers one unit of energy when it does one unit of work. A horsepower is equal to 550 ft lb/s, and a kilowatt is 1000 watts.\n[3] - Here are 5 main types of energy and examples of them. 1  mechanical energy. 2  Mechanical energy is energy that results from movement or the location of an object. 3  Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy.\n[4] Forces are interactions that can change an object's momentum, while energy is a scalar quantity representing the capacity to do work. Forces are vectors, having both magnitude and direction, whereas energy does not have a direction.\n[5] Work-Energy Principle If a moving object is stopped by a collision, extending the stopping distance will reduce the average impact force. The rate of doing work is equal to the rate of using energy since the a force transfers one unit of energy when it does one unit of work.

Forces are vectors, having magnitude and direction, whereas energy is a scalar quantity.\n[7] Difference Between Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy • Categorized under Physics,Science | Difference Between Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy. In physics, matter is considered to possess two kinds of energies ‘“ kinetic or potential energy. Kinetic energy is defined as the energy an object displays or possesses because of some kind of motion or action. Potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy an object possesses or displays by virtue of its state of rest. While potential energy is non-related to the environment of the object, kinetic energy is completely relative to the other moving or stationary objects in the environment. If an object is moving in an environment where other objects are moving too, the acceleration of the object will not be evident at all.\n[8] Forces can cause changes in energy, such as when friction converts kinetic energy into thermal energy. However, energy is also associated with other phenomena like light and chemical reactions, which aren't directly caused by forces.\n[9] Energy is the capacity to do work, while force is a push or pull that can cause a change in momentum. They are related because forces can transfer or convert energy.\n[10] Difference Between Work and Energy On the other hand, energy is defined as the force which acts in a certain distance.

A larger dilation might suggest a stronger feeling of attraction or arousal.\n[2] Pupil dilation can sometimes occur due to stress or anxiety, which might be triggered by the presence of someone.\n[3] What to Expect When Your Eyes Are Dilated 01, 2016. Your eye doctor will put a small amount of dilating eye drops into each of your eyes. It usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes for your pupils to fully open. Light-colored eyes (such as blue, green or hazel) will dilate faster than brown eyes. While your eyes are dilated, your vision will be blurry. You will have trouble focusing on close objects. You also will be extra sensitive to bright light.\n[4] - Your pupils can dilate dramatically when you are excited, or especially when sexually stimulated, due to the release of oxytocin and adrenaline. In addition to dilated pupils, these chemicals also causes your mind to race, muscles to tense up, and breathing to go faster.\n[5] Pupil dilation is often associated with attraction and interest. If your pupils dilate when you see someone, it could be a subconscious indicator that you find them appealing.\n[6] - 5 Xper mho 30%. It is scientifically proven that one's pupils dilate when they see something that they are interested in or like. Also, there is a unusual shine the person's eyes that can be noticed if they like you or are enjoying your company. 2. Asker. Thank you very much!

The body is able to produce normal-sized red blood cells, but the overall volume is reduced due to hemorrhage.\n[3] Hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells are destroyed prematurely, can also present as normocytic anemia if the bone marrow is able to keep up with production to some extent. However, if the rate of destruction exceeds production, it will lead to anemia.\n[4] Normocytic anemia is often associated with chronic diseases. These include kidney disease (leading to decreased erythropoietin production), chronic inflammation, and certain cancers. These conditions disrupt the normal production of red blood cells.\n[5] - Causes of anemia can be grouped into two categories: anemia caused by insufficient RBC production and anemia caused by RBCs being destroyed too soon. 1  Anemia due to inadequate red blood cell production: Several conditions can cause a reduced production of red blood cells, including: Iron deficiency anemia.\n[6] - Congenital normocytic anemia is caused by the breaking up of red blood cells. Sickle cell disease is a congenital disorder of red blood cells. The most common cause of the acquired form of normocytic anemia is a long-term (chronic) disease.Chronic diseases that can cause normocytic anemia include kidney disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroiditis.Some medicines can cause you to have normocytic anemia, but this does not happen often.t means you have normal-sized red blood cells, but you have a low number of them.

For example, when anemia is caused by having too little iron in your diet, you have small red blood cells.\n[7] Anemia It can also be classified based on the size of red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell. If the cells are small, it is microcytic anemia. If they are large, it is macrocytic anemia while if they are normal sized, it is normocytic anemia. Diagnosis in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL), while in women, it must be less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL), Further testing is then required to determine the cause.\n[8] The patient had a broken arm and the doctor recommended some pain medication.\n /think"}], "solution": "[6](4) > [3](3) = [4](3) > [1](2) = [2](2) > [7](1) > [5](0) = [8](0)"}

This network involves the interaction of antibodies with their corresponding anti-idiotypic antibodies, leading to complex feedback mechanisms that maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity.\n[3] Anti-idiotype antibodies can mimic the structure of an antigen, thereby binding to the same receptor on immune cells. This interaction can stimulate or suppress the immune response, influencing processes like B cell activation and antibody production.\n[4] Idiotype The idiotype is based upon the variable region (labeled VL and VH in the diagram.). In immunology, an idiotype is a shared characteristic between a group of immunoglobulin or T cell receptor (TCR) molecules based upon the antigen binding specificity and therefore structure of their variable region.he variable region of antigen receptors of T cells (TCRs) and B cells (immunoglobulins) contain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with unique amino acid sequences. They define the surface and properties of the variable region, determining the antigen specificity and therefore the idio tope of the molecule.\n[5] The network theory suggests that the immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes and anti-idiotypes. This theoretical framework, while influential, doesn't explicitly detail the molecular mechanisms of idiotypic interactions beyond simple recognition.\n[6] Immunity, Hypersensitivity and Transplant rejection- step pathogenesis: grafted immunocompetent T cell proliferate in the immunocompromised host and reject host cells with foreign protein--> severe organ dysfunction. Type IV hypersensitivity reaction features: maculopapular rash, jaundice, diarrhea, heptosplenomegaly. usually in bone marrow and liver transplants which are rich in lymphocytes\n /think"}], "solution": "[4](4) > [2](3) > [3](2) > [5](1) > [1](0) = [6](0)"}

Written communication can include non-verbal elements like handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words, or the format and physical layout of a page that can effect how it is understood.\n[2] - In many jurisdictions, a fully integrated written contract is considered the final and complete expression of the parties' agreement, superseding any prior verbal understandings.\n[3] Can Verbal Terms be Included in a Written Contract? The High Court has unanimously decided that verbal terms made before a written contract generally will not override that written contract. Once a written contract has been executed, the parties are bound, and the courts will hold the parties to their written obligations.\n[4] - Oral agreements can be legally binding, but their enforceability depends on factors like clarity of terms and evidence of mutual intent.\n[5] - The 'parol evidence rule' generally prevents the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict a fully integrated written contract, suggesting the written agreement takes precedence.\n[6] - The legal definition of 'consideration' in contract law often involves a mutual exchange of benefits between parties, such as money, goods, or services, not the format of agreement.\n[7] - Courts often favor written contracts because they provide a clear and documented record of the agreed-upon terms, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes.\n[8] - While a written contract generally holds more weight, proving the terms of a verbal agreement can be possible with evidence like witness testimony or emails referencing the agreement.\n[9] - On the contrary, the agreements you'll want to put into a written contract are best expressed in simple, everyday English. Most contracts only need to contain two elements to be legally valid: All parties must be in agreement (after an offer has been made by one party and accepted by the other).\n[10] - State laws vary regarding contract enforceability, sometimes requiring specific contracts, like real estate agreements, to be written.\n /think"}], "solution": "[2](4) = [3](4) > [5](3) = [7](3) > [4](2) = [8](2) > [9](1) = [10](1) > [1](0) = [6](0)"}

One terabyte (TB) is about 1000 gigabytes, or roughly 1 trillion bytes. You can buy 1 TB and 2 TB hard drives today, so we are just beginning the time when this term comes in to common use. Gigabyte used to be a rare term too, until Moore's law made it common.\n[2] - Gigabyte (1 000 000 000 bytes). 1  1 Gigabyte: A pickup truck filled with paper OR A symphony in high-fidelity sound OR A movie at TV quality. 2  2 Gigabytes: 20 meters of shelved books OR A stack of 9-track tapes.\n[3] What does a gigabyte limit on my internet plan really mean? A little math. As a rule of thumb, a GB or gigabyte is a billion bytes, or 1,000 MB (megabytes), 1,000,000 KB (kilobytes) or 1,000,000,000 bytes. So that 2.5GB cap means that you can transfer 2.5 billion bytes of information before hitting that cap.\n[4] Gigabytes are often used to measure the size of computer files, such as videos or software applications.\n[5] One gigabyte is equal to 2 to the 30th power bytes, or 1,073,741,824 bytes.\n[6] A gigabyte (GB) is a unit of data storage equal to 1,024 megabytes (MB). It is commonly used to measure the size of files, storage capacity, and data transfer amounts.\n[7] A gigabyte is a unit of information equal to one billion bytes or 2^30 bytes. The definition depends on the context (see definitions of gigabyte above). In common usage, a gigabyte is a unit of measurement for computer memory or disk space.\n[8] What is the best cloud storage solution for backing up my photos?\n[9] A gigabyte (GB) is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. One gigabyte is equal to one billion (1,000,000,000) bytes when used in a decimal context (SI prefix), and equal to 1,073,741,824 (230) bytes when used in a binary context.\n[10] 1 GB equals 1024 MB. A gigabyte is 1024 megabytes. So, to work out the number of megabytes in 7 gigabytes, you need to multiply 7 by 1024. 7 GB = 7 x 1024 MB = 7168 MB.\n /think"}], "solution": "[2](4) = [10](4) > [7](3) = [9](3) > [5](2) = [6](2) > [3](1) = [4](1) > [1](0) = [8](0)"}

They also consider your MCAT score, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and personal statement.\n[2] GPA and MCAT The MCAT score. Each of the three multiple-choice sections (biological sciences, physical sciences, verbal reasoning) is worth 15 points for a total of 45 points, but it is nearly impossible to achieve a perfect score. The average MCAT score each year is somewhere around a 24 (eighty in each section). A good score that is competitive at most MD schools is around 30 and a stellar score is somewhere above a 34 to 36, which is competitive at the top medical schools in the country.\n[3] According to the AAMC, the average GPA for students accepted to medical school is around 3.7. A GPA above 3.8 is considered very competitive, while a GPA below 3.5 may make it more difficult to get accepted.\n[4] Medical School Rankings Medical School Rankings: Average MCAT Scores for Medical Schools. Average MCAT scores for medical schools can tell prospective students a lot about the quality of a particular program. The computer-based standardized test has become the standard in which medical schools accept or decline students. Scoring between 7 and 9 on the MCAT can usually get a student into a top 150 school. To get into a top 10 medical school, a score of 11 or higher is a necessity. For instance, the average MCAT score for Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine is 12.4.\n[5] Most sources agree that a GPA of 3.6 or higher is desirable for medical school applicants. Competitive applicants often have GPAs of 3.8 or higher, particularly at top-tier institutions.\n[6] Whatâs a good science GPA? Is it more important than my cumulative GPA? If either your science or your cumulative GPA is lower than 3.0, you may want to reconsider your career choice. 3.0 is a cut-off for most schools, and even if you can bring it up into the 3.1-3.3 range, you’re in dicey territory. Most medical schools consider a 3.75 overall GPA competitive. As a rule of thumb, your science GPA should not be more than .2 lower than your overall GPA. The average cumulative GPA in 2010 for students accepted to medical schools was 3.67, and the average science GPA was 3.61. What does that tell you?\n[7] A GPA of 3.8 or higher is considered highly competitive for medical school admissions and significantly improves your chances of acceptance at top programs.\n[8] A GPA of 3.5 or higher is generally considered a good GPA for medical school. However, the higher your GPA, the better your chances of getting accepted.\n[9] The effect of mandatory courses on student GPA: An examination of introductory psychology. This study investigated the effect of mandatory introductory psychology courses on student GPA. Results indicated no significant impact of mandatory courses on overall GPA.\n[10] Many medical schools look at trends in GPA.

A Net ton is a short ton or 2000 lbs. 86 people found this useful.\n[2] How much does a truck weigh in tons? A typical half ton truck (chevy 1500, ford f-150, etc) weighs anywhere from 2.25 tons to 2.75 tons (4500-5500#). Of course extended cab, regular cab, and crew cabs …account for this varying weight. Next you have 3/4 ton trucks (C20, 2500, f-250, etc). Again, they can be long bed, short bed, extended cab, crew cab, etc.\n[3] Gross ton is a synonym for long ton, which equals 2,240 pounds. It's used especially when discussing shipping and freight. Knowing this conversion is important for accurate weight calculations.\n[4] A gross ton is equivalent to a long ton, which is defined as 2,240 pounds. This unit is frequently used in maritime contexts and for measuring the weight of large quantities of goods.\n[5] A ton is a unit of weight.

This is the standard definition and is crucial for various applications requiring precise weight measurements in specific industries.\n[8] The term 'ton' can refer to different units of weight. A gross ton, equivalent to a long ton, is 2,240 pounds. Understanding the context is key when dealing with weight measurements.\n[9] A gross ton, also known as a long ton, is a unit of weight equal to 2,240 pounds. It is commonly used in the shipping industry to measure the weight of cargo.\n[10] - Gross Weight is the Net weight plus the tare, the tare being the mass of the container the item is contained within. Example: a package containing a steak in a supermark … et freezer has a net weight of 650grams. The gross weight is the 650grams plus the 10-12 grams of tray and packaging.\n /think"}], "solution": "[1](4) = [7](4) > [3](3) = [4](3) > [8](2) = [9](2) > [5](1) = [10](1) > [2](0) = [6](0)"}

In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties: 1  One can get any vector in the vector space by multiplying each of the basis vectors by different numbers, and then adding them up.  If any vector is removed from the basis, the property above is no longer satisfied.\n[7] A basis for a vector space V is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span V.
