Such a diet, which is typically high in refined carbohydrates and fat and low in fiber, leads to a reduction in the synthesis of bile acids by the liver, which in turn significantly reduces the solubility of the bile. A high intake of refined sugar is also a risk factor for gallstones. The frequency of gallstones is two to four times as great in women as in men. Women are predisposed to gallstones because of either increased cholesterol synthesis or suppression of bile acids by estrogens. /no think"}], "solution": "yes"}
