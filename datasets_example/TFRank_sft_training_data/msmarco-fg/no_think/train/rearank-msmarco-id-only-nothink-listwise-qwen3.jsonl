Air Brakes Turn the electrical power on and step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. The low air pressure warning signal must come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank (or tank with the lowest air pressure, in dual air systems). See Figure 5.5.\n[2] Air Brakes  Endorsement Test Check the Air Brake System. The Seven-Step Air Brake check -DO THIS AT PRETRIP INSPECTION when performing the Skills Test portion of the CDL exam. Designed to test the governor cut-in and cut-out pressures, air pressure leakage, warning buzzer, brake valves and air pressure rebuild rates. Brakes off means the yellow and/or red valve is pushed in (on = valve out). 1. Engine on / Brakes on  check gauges to make sure governor cuts compressor off at 120 psi.\n[3] Air brakes are a complex system that uses compressed air to stop vehicles. The main components include an air compressor, reservoirs, foot valve, and brake chambers. When the driver presses the brake pedal, air is released from the reservoirs to the brake chambers, applying pressure to the brake pads and slowing the vehicle. Releasing the pedal exhausts the air, releasing the brakes.\n[4] How do Air Brakes work? An air brake or, more formally, a compressed air brake system, is a type of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the pressure to the brake pad needed to stop the vehicle.\n[5] Troubleshooting common air brake problems often involves checking for air leaks, inspecting brake lines, and ensuring proper air pressure levels are maintained. Ignoring these issues can result in reduced braking efficiency.\n[6] An air brake is a type of braking system that uses compressed air to actuate the brakes. It is commonly used in heavy vehicles such as trucks, buses, and trains.\n[7] The Importance of Regular Car Maintenance. Regular car maintenance is crucial for ensuring your vehicle runs smoothly and safely. Neglecting maintenance can lead to costly repairs and even dangerous situations.\n[8] Air brake systems are commonly used in large vehicles such as trucks and buses. These systems require routine inspections and maintenance to ensure proper function and safety.\n[9] Air brakes use compressed air to apply force to the brake pads, creating friction and slowing the vehicle. The system consists of an air compressor, air tanks, brake chambers, and various valves.\n[10] Air brake systems typically include an air compressor to generate compressed air, storage tanks to hold the compressed air, and brake chambers that convert the air pressure into mechanical force to apply the brakes.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[4] = [3] > [6] = [10] > [5] = [9] > [8] = [2] > [1] = [7]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[4] = [3] > [6] = [10] > [5] = [9] > [8] = [2] > [1] = [7]"}

If you are currently taking any of the medications/supplements listed below, speak with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Prednisone. The following medications may increase the risk of side effects with Prednisone: azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), certain antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), cyclosporine, grapefruit juice, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir).\n[2] How long does methylprednisolone stay in your system? In brief: At 36hrs. It takes 36 hrs for the drug to be less than 10per cent of the dose. But if you mean after long term use, your adrenal glands will be suppressed for a much longer period than after a single dose! In brief: At 36hrs. It takes 36 hrs for the drug to be less than 10per cent of the dose.\n[3] It generally takes about 16.5 to 22 hours for prednisone to be eliminated from the body. This is based on the drug's half-life, which is approximately 3 to 4 hours. It takes around 5.5 half-lives for a drug to be considered fully cleared from the system.\n[4] According to drugs.com, The elimination half-life of prednisone is 2 to 3 hours. It usually takes 5 to 6 half-lives for a drug to be eliminated from your system. Therefore, it takes approximately 10 to 18 hours for prednisone to be eliminated from your body.\n[5] The half-life of prednisone is around 2-4 hours. This means that after 2-4 hours, half of the drug will be eliminated from your body. It usually takes about 5-6 half-lives for a drug to be effectively eliminated, so prednisone can stay in your system for 10-24 hours.\n[6] The half-life of prednisone is approximately 2-4 hours.  It takes roughly 5-6 half-lives to eliminate a drug, meaning prednisone is mostly gone within 10-24 hours.  However, effects on the adrenal glands can last longer.\n[7] - 1 Not getting enough oxygen can cause darker eye bags. 2  Put a cold spoon under each eye. 3  Put cucumbers on your eyes. 4  About 25% of the worlds population have a natural dark shade under their eyes, usually the people in which this occurs, dont get enough vitamin D into their body. Apply the concealer with your finger or a cotton ball. 2  Make sure you dab it on lightly instead of rubbing it into your skin. 3  The makeup will conceal your bags more effectively if it stays on the surface of your skin. 4  Follow the concealer with a brush of powder to help it set and stay in place all day.\n[8] Factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual metabolism can influence how long prednisone remains in your system. Generally, it takes several days to weeks for the drug to be completely eliminated.\n[9] How long does Prednisone stay in your system? In this time the body lowers the levels of the plasma by half. For the drug to be eliminated completely from the system usually 5.5 lives are needed. Thus one can expect the elimination of the dose of prednisone within 16 to 22 hours from the body. Some of the factors to be kept in mind are as follows: 1.\n[10] Prednisone's effects can linger for days after you stop taking it, especially if you've been on it for a long time. This is due to its impact on the adrenal glands, which may take time to recover their normal function.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[9] = [6] > [4] = [3] > [8] = [5] > [10] = [2] > [7] = [1]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[9] = [6] > [4] = [3] > [8] = [5] > [10] = [2] > [7] = [1]"}

With their textured, sun bleached look, these split pods will bring an organic element to your wedding or gathering.\n[2] - Full Definition of NUTSHELL. 1. : the hard external covering in which the kernel of a nut is enclosed. 2. : something of small size, amount, or scope. — in a nutshell.\n[3] The phrase 'shell the nut' can refer to the literal act of removing a nut from its shell, or it can be a metaphor for getting to the core of a problem or idea.\n[4] The process of shelling a nut involves cracking or breaking the hard outer layer (shell) to expose the edible kernel inside. Different nuts require different methods, from using a nutcracker to simply applying pressure.\n[5] To 'shell' a nut means to remove its outer protective layer, usually to prepare it for eating or cooking. This involves cracking or breaking the shell to reveal the edible kernel inside.\n[6] Shell You are here: Dictionary S-Definitions.

For example: `Func<int, int> expression = (x) => { int localVar = x * 2; return localVar + 1; };` Here, 'localVar' is defined locally within the lambda expression and is only accessible within that scope, effectively enabling local variable definition inside an expression.\n[2] While you cannot directly declare a variable within the body of a LINQ query expression in C#, you can sometimes achieve similar results by using a separate scope or a helper function to pre-calculate values.  This workaround allows you to indirectly introduce a locally defined value used within the query.\n[3] Transact-SQL Variables A Transact-SQL local variable is an object that can hold a single data value of a specific type. Variables in batches and scripts are typically used: As a counter either to count the number of times a loop is performed or to control how many times the loop is performed.\n[4] Lambda Expressions (C# Programming Guide) A lambda expression is an anonymous function that you can use to create delegates or expression tree types. By using lambda expressions, you can write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the value of function calls.ambdas can refer to outer variables (see Anonymous Methods (C# Programming Guide)) that are in scope in the method that defines the lambda function, or in scope in the type that contains the lambda expression.\n[5] C#'s null-coalescing operator (??) or the conditional operator (?:) can be used within an expression to conditionally assign a value, effectively creating a localized assignment. For example: `string result = (value != null) ? value : (defaultValue = \"Some Default\");` This implicitly defines 'defaultValue' in the scope where 'result' is used.\n[6] Arrays In C# In C#, arrays are objects. That means that declaring an array doesn't create an array. After declaring an array, you need to instantiate an array by using the new operator.

A: Our typical escrow period, in the Bay Area for a mortgage-funded purchase is between 24 and 30 days. That being said, there are as many variables as there are documents in a transaction and they can prolong an escrow.t that point, the buyer can sign off on this contingency, ask for a price reduction or request repairs. So, while a typical escrow is 30 days, they can go from one week to many weeks. Karen Richardson, Alain Pinel Realtors, Orinda, (925)639-3904, karen@karenrichardsongroup.com.\n[2] Escrow closing times can vary based on location. In some states, the typical escrow period is 30 days, while in others it may be closer to 60 days.\n[3] On average, escrow takes 30-45 days to complete. This timeline includes all necessary steps, such as the title search, appraisal, and loan approval. However, it can be shorter or longer depending on the complexity of the transaction.\n[4] The length of escrow can vary, but it usually takes between 30 and 60 days. Factors such as the buyer's financing, property inspections, and title search can all impact the timeline.\n[5] One factor that can affect how long escrow takes is the type of financing the buyer is using. For example, if the buyer is using a conventional loan, the escrow period may be shorter than if the buyer is using a government-backed loan.\n[6] The Home Closing Process Most federally related mortgage loans can close within 30 days. Special first-time home buyer programs, particularly those involving help with the buyer's down payment, might take 35 to 45 days to close. These special loans typically require approval from two underwriting processes.\n[7] - For four years in a row, the time it took to go from contract to close was 30 days for a normal transaction between 2005 and 2008 according to C.A.R.'s Annual Housing Market Survey. In the last two years, with the current tough underwriting standards for mortgage loans, escrow is taking a bit longer—about 40 days.But actually the length of time it takes to close escrow is the same as it was in 2003 (just prior to the mortgage frenzy of '04, '05, and ‘06).This shows the market returning to somewhat normal conditions as escrow companies are taking their time to review, document, and close the transaction. tell my clients right now that even though we are shooting for a 30 day escrow is typically going to be 40 -45 days mostly because lenders are taking extra time with appraisals and document reviews. clear skies, Doug Reynolds. 1  January 27 2011 - Sacramento.\n[8] Escrow is a process where a neutral third party holds funds or assets until specific conditions are met. While escrow protects all parties involved, it also adds time to the closing process.

As a simple figure, the incremental cost of a widget would include the wages for an hour in addition to the cost of materials used in production of a widget.\n[2] A company is evaluating whether to extend its operating hours. The incremental cost would be the cost of keeping the lights on longer, any additional wages paid to employees for the extended hours, and any additional utility costs.\n[3] Consider a scenario where a business is deciding whether to accept a special order. The special order will increase production by 100 units. The incremental cost would be the additional costs incurred to produce those 100 units, such as raw materials and direct labor.\n[4] - DEFINITION of 'Incremental Analysis'. A decision-making technique used in business to determine the true cost difference between alternatives.Incremental analysis ignores sunk costs and costs that are the same between the two alternatives to look only at the remaining costs.For this reason, it is also called the relevant cost approach , marginal analysis or differential analysis..REAKING DOWN 'Incremental Analysis'. If a company is considering replacing its old copy machine, using incremental analysis, the company would not look at the cost of the existing copy machine because it is a sunk cost (the cost of buying it cannot be reversed).\n[5] Cost Per Unit How it works/Example: For example, let's assume it costs Company XYZ $10,000 to purchase 5,000 widgets that it will resell in its retail outlets. Company XYZ's cost per unit is: $10,000 / 5,000 = $2 per unit. Often, calculating the cost per unit isn't so simple, especially in manufacturing situations. Usually, costs per unit involve variable costs (costs that vary with the number of units made) and fixed costs (costs that don't vary with the number of units made). For example, at XYZ Restaurant, which sells only pepperoni pizza, the variable expenses per pizza might be: Flour: $0.50. Yeast: $0.05.\n[6] Imagine a car manufacturer is already producing 1,000 cars per month. They are considering increasing production to 1,100 cars per month. The incremental cost is the additional cost incurred by producing those extra 100 cars. This would include the cost of additional raw materials (steel, tires, glass), additional labor costs, and any additional energy costs incurred in the factory.\n[7] Suppose a bakery is considering baking an extra batch of cookies. The incremental cost would include the cost of the additional ingredients (flour, sugar, chocolate chips) and the extra electricity used by the oven.\n[8] A company is considering adding a new product line. The initial investment is $100,000, and the projected annual revenue is $50,000. The incremental cost of producing and selling each unit is $10. This example touches on incremental costs.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[1] > [6] = [2] > [7] = [3] > [4] = [8] > [5]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[1] > [6] = [2] > [7] = [3] > [4] = [8] > [5]"}

The competitive exclusion principle is an ecological principle stating that when two competing life forms attempt to occupy the same niche, only one outcome is possible: One life form will drive out the other.\n[2] Sustainable Competitive Advantages: Definition, Types, & Examples Definition: Sustainable Competitive Advantages. Sustainable competitive advantages are company assets, attributes, or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or exceed; and provide a superior or favorable long term position over competitors.\n[3] A competitive advantage is anything that gives a company an edge over its rivals, helping it attract more customers and grow its market share. While some advantages are sustainable, others are easily copied by competitors.\n[4] A sustainable competitive advantage is a company's ability to create more economic value than its rivals over the long term. It is based on unique capabilities and resources that are difficult to imitate or substitute, providing a lasting edge in the marketplace.\n[5] Sustainable competitive advantages stem from core competencies that create long-term value for customers and are difficult for competitors to replicate. These advantages often involve a combination of factors, such as proprietary technology, strong brand reputation, efficient operations, and a customer-centric culture, all working together to create a powerful barrier to entry for rivals.\n[6] A sustainable competitive advantage is a long-term benefit that allows a company to outperform its competition consistently. This advantage is typically built on unique resources, capabilities, or strategies that are difficult for rivals to imitate or acquire, ensuring a sustained period of superior performance and profitability.\n[7] Sustainable competitive advantage can be defined as a company's ability to maintain profits that exceed the average for its industry over a long period. It's often achieved through unique resources, capabilities, or strategies that are difficult for competitors to replicate.\n[8] Competitive advantage [1] There is no one answer about what is competitive advantage or one way to measure it, and for the right reason. Nearly everything can be considered as competitive edge, e.g. higher profit margin, greater return on assets, valuable resource such as brand reputation or unique competence in producing jet engines. Every company must have at least one advantage to successfully compete in the market.\n[9] Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage requires a company to continually adapt and innovate. While initial advantages might stem from a new product or service, maintaining that advantage demands ongoing investment in research and development, customer service, and operational efficiency.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [4] > [6] = [5] > [9] = [7] > [8] = [3] > [1]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [4] > [6] = [5] > [9] = [7] > [8] = [3] > [1]"}

Regular conditioning can help maintain its color and prevent drastic changes.\n[2] Does leather crack in the cold? Yes, leather can crack in the cold, particularly if it's not properly conditioned. When temperatures drop, leather loses moisture, causing it to become stiff and brittle. This makes it more susceptible to cracking, especially when bent or flexed. To prevent this, regularly apply a leather conditioner to keep the leather supple and moisturized, which will help it withstand cold weather conditions.\n[3] What is the best way to clean a fabric sofa?\n[4] Repairing a Bleach Stain on Leather The bleach has removed the color-coat from the top of your leather.

It does not mention anything about organic farming or vegetable cultivation.\n[2] Urea Urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and is an important raw material for the chemical industry. Friedrich Wöhler's discovery in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry.\n[3] Urea Urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and is an important raw material for the chemical industry. Friedrich Wöhler's discovery in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry.\n[4] According to the National Organic Program (NOP) standards in the United States, urea is not permitted for use as a fertilizer in certified organic crop production.\n[5] - Urea is decomposed by the enzyme urease or chemically hydrolyzed into ammonia and CO 2. In the ammonification step, ammonia is converted by ammonium-oxidizing bacteria into ammonium. In a next step, ammonium is converted by nitrifying bacteria into nitrate (nitrification).The nitrogen conversion rate depends on the conditions, present in the soil for nitrifying bacteria. Nitrates can be readily absorbed by the plant and do not need to undergo any further conversion, as is the case with urea and ammonium, before plant uptake. 2  No acidification of the soil if all the nitrogen is applied as nitrate-nitrogen.\n[6] The general consensus among organic agriculture experts is that urea is not suitable for organic vegetable farming due to its synthetic origin and potential negative impacts on soil health when used improperly. It goes against organic principles of using natural and sustainable inputs.\n[7] DEF: Here to Stay ADVERTISEMENT. DEF is a necessity to make this happen. Kept in a separate reservoir tank from the diesel fuel, it’s a solution of 32.5% high-purity urea mixed with very high-purity water. Urea is an organic nitrogen-containing compound commonly used in agriculture as a fertilizer.owever, you can’t just buy fertilizer and make your own DEF. The urea used to make DEF is known as automotive grade or environmental grade, a higher grade than the kind used for fertilizer. Although it meant a new technology and a new fluid to deal with, the good news was, SCR meant fuel savings.\n[8] While urea is a nitrogen fertilizer, its use in organic farming is generally prohibited by most certification standards because it is synthetically produced. Organic farmers rely on natural sources of nitrogen like compost, manure, and cover crops.\n[9] Many sources claim that urea is not allowed in certified organic agriculture due to its synthetic manufacturing process, but it can be used as a nitrogen fertilizer for conventional crops.\n[10] Some studies show that foliar application of low biuret urea can improve plant health, but organic standards typically restrict its use to ensure ecological sustainability.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [6] = [4] > [10] = [8] > [3] = [9] > [5] > [7] = [1]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [6] = [4] > [10] = [8] > [3] = [9] > [5] > [7] = [1]"}

Hemp is defined as Cannabis sativa with less than 0.3% THC. Marijuana is defined as Cannabis sativa with more than 0.3% THC.\n[6] Hemp and marijuana are both the same species of plant, Cannabis sativa, but are different varieties, often referred to as strains. Hemp is a variety of Cannabis sativa that contains 0.3% or less THC by dry weight, while marijuana is a variety of Cannabis sativa that contains more than 0.3% THC by dry weight.\n[7] Botanically, hemp and marijuana are both Cannabis sativa, but legally and practically, they are differentiated by their THC content. Hemp is cannabis with very low THC levels, making it unsuitable for recreational use.\n[8] Yes, hemp is a type of cannabis plant, specifically Cannabis sativa. However, it's cultivated for industrial purposes and contains very low levels of THC, unlike marijuana varieties.\n[9] 5 Differences Between Hemp and Marijuana Hemp and marijuana are two popular names for the cannabis plant. The word cannabis often brings to mind images of a burning joint or a bong filling up with white smoke.Most of the time, the term wouldn’t be equated with plant-based plastics, durable paper or military grade fabric.ny cannabis with higher THC levels is considered marijuana instead. In comparison, medical marijuana produces anywhere between 5-20% THC on average, with prize strains tipping the scale at 25-30% THC. Hemp and marijuana plants contain another important cannabinoid: CBD.\n[10] Legally, hemp is defined as a cannabis plant containing 0.3% or less tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by dry weight.

Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field.lectric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge e; we say that electric charge is quantized. Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge.\n[3] The history of electricity dates back to ancient times, with observations of static electricity by the Greeks. However, significant advancements were made in the 18th and 19th centuries by scientists such as Benjamin Franklin, Alessandro Volta, and Michael Faraday.\n[4] Charging can refer to the process of replenishing the energy in a battery or capacitor. It involves applying a voltage to the device, causing an electric current to flow and store energy within it. The rate of charging is often measured in Amperes (A).\n[5] What is a Charging System?

This helps ensure the baby fully empties the breast, stimulating milk production.\n[4] Increasing Your Milk Supply If your milk supply is low, here are some suggestions on how to increase it: 1  Monitor your baby’s weight often, especially in the early days and weeks. 2  Take care of yourself. 3  Nurse frequently for as long as your baby will nurse.  Offer both breasts at each 1  feeding. Try massaging the breast gently as you nurse.\n[5] Tips for a Healthy Pregnancy: During pregnancy, it's important to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular exercise to ensure a healthy pregnancy and prepare your body for lactation.\n[6] The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global supply chains, leading to shortages and price increases for many goods. This has affected various industries, including manufacturing, retail, and agriculture.\n[7] Pumping to Increase Milk Supply: Frequent pumping, especially after nursing, can signal your body to produce more milk. Ensure you're using the correct flange size for optimal milk expression.\n[8] Colostrum is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands in late pregnancy and the few days after giving birth. It contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease.\n[9] Different Ways You Can Use Fenugreek For Increasing Breast Milk: Fenugreek can be taken in different ways during your lactation period. 1. Tea: You can add around 3 teaspoons of fenugreek seeds in a cup of water and bring it to boil to make the tea. You can have this around three times a day.\n[10] Nutrition and milk Energy intake. As the energy of the diet increases so too does the protein yield and concentration of the milk. Ellinbank work would indicate that restricted intake (50% reduction) in early lactation, decreases protein concentration during early lactation by 0.3% units.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[9] = [4] > [1] = [3] > [2] = [7] > [5] = [8] > [6] = [10]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[9] = [4] > [1] = [3] > [2] = [7] > [5] = [8] > [6] = [10]"}

They are caused by germs that live on the skin or in body fluids such as semen, vaginal fluid or blood. The germs are passed from an infected person often through sexual contact with skin, blood or body fluids.These germs can enter the body through the vagina, mouth, anus and open sores or cuts. STDs are not spread by casual contact, by being in swimming pools or by sitting on toilet seats.he germs are passed from an infected person often through sexual contact with skin, blood or body fluids. These germs can enter the body through the vagina, mouth, anus and open sores or cuts.\n[2] Certain STDs, such as HIV, can be monitored through viral load testing in the blood, which measures the amount of the virus present.\n[3] Blood tests can detect several STDs, including HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C. These tests look for antibodies or antigens produced by the body in response to the infection.\n[4] Many STDs are diagnosed through blood tests, including HIV, syphilis, and some types of hepatitis. The specific tests look for antibodies or antigens related to these infections.\n[5] To determine if a substance is present in a blood sample, a phlebotomist must collect the blood and send it to a lab for testing. The lab technician will then use different testing methods to assess the sample. These tests might look for specific antibodies, antigens, or other indicators that reveal the presence of drugs, diseases, or other substances.\n[6] Will A Blood Test Detect All STDs? To summarize, the only blood tests commonly done for STDs test for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B. A blood test for herpes exists but is seldom done. A good urethral test for gonorrhea and chlamydia exists, but is seldom done in men unless specifically requested.\n[7] Tests for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) In this article.

In 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was invented by Willis Carrier in Buffalo, New York. After graduating from Cornell University, Carrier found a job at the Buffalo Forge Company.\n[2] In 1902, Willis Carrier created the first system to control temperature, humidity, ventilation, and air quality. It was designed to solve a humidity problem at a printing plant in Brooklyn, New York.\n[3] A Brief History of Air Conditioning 1830s At the Florida hospital where he works, Dr. John Gorrie builds an ice-making machine that uses compression to make buckets of ice and then blows air over them. He patents the idea in 1851, imagining his invention cooling buildings all over the world.\n[4] John Gorrie, an American physician, is often considered one of the pioneers of air conditioning. In the mid-19th century, he designed a machine that created ice to cool the air for his patients suffering from malaria and other fevers.\n[5] Willis Haviland Carrier (November 26, 1876 – October 7, 1950) was an American engineer, best known for inventing modern air conditioning. He invented the first electrical air conditioning unit in 1902.\n[6] Albert Einstein Invention What did Albert Einstein Invent. The Einstein refrigerator is an Albert Einstein invention that uses green technology. It was co-invented with Leo Szilard who was one of his physics students at Zurich University.The invention was patented in 1930 and licensed to various companies including Electrolux.uring that time they were collecting royalties on the Einstein refrigerator. This Albert Einstein invention was the only invention patented by Einstein who became more famous for his theories on physics rather than for his work in refrigeration, although scientists are now investigating this technology.\n[7] Willis Carrier is widely regarded as the inventor of modern air conditioning. He designed the first electrical air conditioning unit in 1902, initially for a printing plant to control humidity and improve print quality.\n[8] While not 'air conditioning' as we know it, in ancient Rome, wealthy citizens used aqueducts to circulate water through the walls of their homes to cool them. This rudimentary form of cooling foreshadowed later developments.\n[9] Several people experimented with cooling systems before air conditioning was invented, including Michael Faraday, who discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could cool air when the liquid ammonia was allowed to evaporate.\n[10] The history of the typewriter involves a number of inventors who tinkered with writing machines in the 1800s, but Christopher Latham Sholes is generally regarded as the father of the modern typewriter.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[5] = [1] > [2] = [7] > [4] = [8] > [9] = [3] > [10] = [6]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[5] = [1] > [2] = [7] > [4] = [8] > [9] = [3] > [10] = [6]"}

By separating variable and fixed costs, it highlights the incremental profit generated by each additional unit sold, aiding in decisions related to production levels and sales strategies.\n[2] The contribution margin income statement is primarily used for internal decision-making. It helps managers understand the relationship between sales, variable costs, and fixed costs, which is crucial for setting prices, determining break-even points, and evaluating the profitability of different products or segments.\n[3] What Do People Use the Contribution Income Statement For? The contribution income statement, also known as the contribution margin income statement, measures costs based on the functional area or segment of a business. This is different from a traditional income statement, which does not distinguish between fixed- and variable-production and selling costs, and which considers the corporation as a whole rather than each segment individually.\n[4] contribution margin ratio definition contribution margin ratio. This ratio indicates the percentage of each sales dollar that is available to cover a company's fixed expenses and profit.The ratio is calculated by dividing the contribution margin (sales minus all variable expenses) by sales.ontribution margin ratio. This ratio indicates the percentage of each sales dollar that is available to cover a company's fixed expenses and profit.\n[5] The contribution margin income statement is a powerful tool for managerial decision making because it clearly separates variable and fixed costs. This allows managers to assess the profitability of individual products or segments, make informed pricing decisions, and evaluate the impact of changes in sales volume or cost structure on the company's overall profitability.\n[6] Contribution margin income statements are used in cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, which helps managers understand the relationship between costs, volume, and profit. This analysis can be used to determine the break-even point, target profit, and optimal sales mix.\n[7] How to Compute Contribution Margin Contribution margin, in any of its forms, explains how different factors in the company — sales price, sales volume, variable costs, and fixed costs — interact. This understanding helps you make better decisions when planning sales and costs.\n[8] Contribution margin can help companies decide whether to add or subtract a product line. For example, if a product line has a negative contribution margin, the company may want to consider discontinuing it.\n[9] Contribution margin analysis can be used to evaluate the impact of changes in sales volume on profitability. For example, a company can use contribution margin to determine the increase in sales needed to offset an increase in fixed costs.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[3] = [1] > [6] = [5] > [2] = [9] > [7] = [8] > [4]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[3] = [1] > [6] = [5] > [2] = [9] > [7] = [8] > [4]"}

On the other hand, sex may not be safe during the third trimester in certain circumstances, including these:\n[5] Some STIs can be passed to your baby during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. These infections can cause serious health problems for your baby, including pneumonia, blindness, and even death. Using condoms every time you have sex is the best way to protect yourself and your baby from STIs.\n[6] If you or your partner are not in a mutually monogamous relationship and have not been recently tested for STIs, unprotected sex during the third trimester is not recommended due to the risk of transmitting infections to the mother and potentially the baby.\n[7] Having unprotected sex at any point during your pregnancy could expose you to an STI which could impact your baby's health.\n[8] During the third trimester, the mother's immune system is naturally suppressed to allow the baby to grow. This can make her more susceptible to infections, so unprotected sex might increase the risk of STIs that could be passed to the baby.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[4] > [6] = [1] > [5] = [8] > [2] = [7] > [3]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[4] > [6] = [1] > [5] = [8] > [2] = [7] > [3]"}

Sir Humphry Davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge.\n[2] Electrolytic cells consist of two electrodes (a cathode and an anode) immersed in an electrolyte solution. A direct current (DC) voltage is applied to the electrodes, causing a non-spontaneous chemical reaction to occur. The anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs.\n[3] An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell that uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous redox reaction. This is in contrast to a galvanic cell, which uses a spontaneous redox reaction to produce electrical energy. The key difference is the application of an external voltage to force the reaction to occur.\n[4] Electrochemistry By the 1810s, William Hyde Wollaston made improvements to the galvanic cell. Sir Humphry Davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge.\n[5] Electrolytes Electrolytes Overview. Electrolytes are the smallest of chemicals that are important for the cells in the body to function and allow the body to work. Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and others are critical in allowing cells to generate energy, maintain the stability of their walls, and to function in general.They generate electricity, contract muscles, move water and fluids within the body, and participate in myriad other activities.lectrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and others are critical in allowing cells to generate energy, maintain the stability of their walls, and to function in general. They generate electricity, contract muscles, move water and fluids within the body, and participate in myriad other activities.\n[6] An electrolytic cell is characterized by the use of an external electrical source to drive a non-spontaneous redox reaction. This means the cell's standard potential is negative, requiring energy input to proceed. Key features include electrodes immersed in an electrolyte, where oxidation occurs at the anode (positive terminal) and reduction at the cathode (negative terminal), ultimately leading to the decomposition of a chemical compound.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[6] = [4] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [5]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[6] = [4] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [5]"}

An Application Service Provider (ASP) is a business providing computer-based services to customers over a network; such as access to a particular software application (such as customer relationship management) using a standard protocol (such as HTTP).SPs may or may not use multitenancy in the deployment of software to clients; some ASPs offer an instance or license to each customer (for example using Virtualization), some deploy in a single instance multi-tenant access mode, now more frequently referred to as SaaS.\n[2] PRINCIPLES OF MARKETING Service is a form of product that consists of activities, benefits, or satisfactions offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in ownership of anything Banking, Hospitals Doctor¶s, Legal advice\n[3] service request service request . Definition: (ITIL Service Operation) A formal request from a user for something to be provided – for example, a request for information or advice; to reset a password; or to install a workstation for a new user. Service requests are managed by the request fulfilment process, usually in conjunction with the service desk. Service requests may be linked to a request for change as part of fulfilling the request.\n[4] Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\n[5] An Application Service Provider (ASP) is a business providing computer-based services to customers over a network; such as access to a particular software application (such as customer relationship management) using a standard protocol (such as HTTP).SPs may or may not use multitenancy in the deployment of software to clients; some ASPs offer an instance or license to each customer (for example using Virtualization), some deploy in a single instance multi-tenant access mode, now more frequently referred to as SaaS.\n[6] In software architecture, service-orientation is a design paradigm that structures an application as a set of loosely coupled services. These services communicate with each other, often over a network, using well-defined interfaces and protocols.\n[7] When an application is designed as a service, it typically means it exposes functionalities via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that other applications or systems can interact with. These APIs define how the application can be accessed and used, allowing for modularity, reusability, and interoperability. The application acts as a provider of specific functionalities, and other applications act as consumers of those functionalities.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[1] = [5] > [7] > [6] > [3] > [4] = [2]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[1] = [5] > [7] > [6] > [3] > [4] = [2]"}

To advertise for the play, the Lord Chamberlain's Men used a flag with Hercules carrying a globe on his shoulders.illiam Shakespeare wrote many plays that were performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men. When the lease ended on the building where they'd previously performed their plays, the Globe Theatre was constructed to give the Chamberlain's Men a new place to perform their acts.\n[3] What was the pit in the globe theatre?

A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed in 1642.he pit was a name for the area immediately surrounding the stage. The tickets for the Pit were and are the cheapest, because there are no seats. You have to watch the play standing up. You get a really close view of the stage, which enables you to be spat upon and maybe worse by the actors.\n[4] Flags were used to signal the type of play being performed. A white flag indicated a comedy, a black flag a tragedy, and a red flag a history play. This helped theatergoers decide which play they wanted to see before entering the Globe.\n[5] The architecture of the Globe Theatre was based on earlier designs, incorporating a large, open-air amphitheater capable of holding thousands of spectators. The circular structure provided excellent acoustics and sightlines, enhancing the overall theatrical experience for the audience.\n[6] The flag flown above the Globe Theatre served primarily as an advertisement for the day's performance. Its color indicated the genre of the play: white for comedy, black for tragedy, and red for history.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] > [6] > [4] > [1] > [5] = [3]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] > [6] > [4] > [1] > [5] = [3]"}

There are two types of tests for Down syndrome that can be performed before your baby is born: screening tests and diagnostic tests. Prenatal screenings estimate the chance of the fetus having Down syndrome. These tests do not tell you for sure whether your fetus has Down syndrome; they only provide a probability. Diagnostic tests, on the other hand, can provide a definitive diagnosis with almost 100% accuracy. There is an extensive menu of prenatal screening tests now available for pregnant women.\n[3] The Harmony test is a non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) test used to determine the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities in a fetus, including Down syndrome (trisomy 21).\n[4] Many pregnant women opt for early screenings like the nuchal translucency ultrasound, which, while not specifically a Down syndrome test, can indicate an increased risk that warrants further investigation.\n[5] The Quad Screen, typically performed in the second trimester, is a blood test that measures levels of four substances in a pregnant woman's blood to assess the risk of Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.\n[6] What happens to the body when you have Down Syndrome? Please explain! The most common form of Down syndrome is known as Trisomy 21, a condition where individuals have 47 chromosomes in each cell instead of 46. This is caused by an error in cell division called nondisjunction, which leaves a sperm or egg cell with an extra copy of chromosome 21 before or at conception.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [3] > [1] > [5] > [4] > [6]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[2] = [3] > [1] > [5] > [4] > [6]"}

In urban areas speed limits vary from 25 mph on residential streets and central business districts to 30–40 mph on arterial roadways, and from 45 to 55 mph on urban freeways.n Pennsylvania the maximum freeway speed limit is generally 65 mph (105 km/h), with a select few sections of rural freeway and parts of the Pennsylvania Turnpike signed at 70 mph (113 km/h). The speed limit on urban freeways ranges from a low of 50 mph in downtown Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to 65 mph in some areas.\n[2] Many jurisdictions require motorists to adjust their speed to account for weather, visibility, traffic, and other conditions. Some examples include 'Too fast for conditions' or 'Exceeding a safe speed'. These are often charged when the motorist is driving at or below the posted speed limit, but the prevailing conditions make that speed unsafe.\n[3] Speed limits on motorways in Germany can be advisory, with a posted speed limit on some expressways being 130 km/h, although this limit is not enforced.\n[4] Speed Limits in New York You must obey the posted speed limit or, if no limit is posted, drive no faster than 55 mph. Be aware, however, that some cities in New York have speed limits lower than 55 mph that may not be posted. For example, the speed limit is 30 mph in New York City unless another limit is posted. It is important to note that the minimum speed on most expressways in the State of New York is 45 miles per hour.

You'll probably still enjoy the end result. However, if you'd like to get a bit closer, here are a couple things you could try, in descending order of effort: 1  Add about 1/2 teaspoon or so of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken and balance the texture of the sambal oelek.\n[2] Tomato paste can be used as a base for many sauces, and while it isn't a direct substitute for either ketchup or tomato sauce, it can be combined with other ingredients to create a similar flavor profile.\n[3] How to Substitute Tomato Sauce for Other Forms of Tomatoes And so it goes.

A league was considered to be the distance a man could walk in one hour, and the mile (from mille, meaning thousand) consisted of 1,000 passus (paces, five feet, or double-step).\n[5] One league is generally accepted to be approximately 3 miles on land.\n[6] The phrase 'within a league of' is an idiom that means 'very close to' something, hinting at the league's historical use as a measure of proximity.\n[7] - 1 Mile [UK, nautical] = 2026.6666667 Yards. There are 1760 yards in a mile, because when the British started using the mile as a distance unit, they related it to furlong (used in agriculture) and made one mile is 8 furlongs. 1 furlong is 220 yards, that makes 8 * 220 = 1760 yards in a mile.\n /no think"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[5] = [1] > [2] > [6] > [4] > [3] = [7]"}], "solution": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n[5] = [1] > [2] > [6] > [4] > [3] = [7]"}

You'll save money on airfare and airport fees, although you'll need to factor in gas and potential maintenance for your vehicle.\n[2] I love summer. I like the beach.\n[3] Experts recommend setting a detailed budget before planning your summer vacation, allocating specific amounts for transportation, lodging, food, activities, and souvenirs. Sticking to this budget can help prevent overspending and ensure a more affordable trip.\n[4] Budgeting for a summer vacation requires careful planning. Start by estimating your transportation, accommodation, food, and activity expenses. Don't forget to factor in unexpected costs and set a realistic daily spending limit to avoid overspending.\n[5] A new study reveals that summer vacation costs have increased by 15% compared to last year, mainly due to rising fuel prices and increased demand for travel. The study also suggests several strategies for mitigating these costs, such as booking in advance and utilizing travel rewards programs.\n[6] Summer vacation In Russia, summer vacation starts on May 25 with the end of an old school year (for 1st–8th and 10th grades) and ends on September 1 with the beginning of a new school year. For 9th and 11th grades, due to exams (EGE), the vacation starts in the middle (9th grade) or in the end (11th grade) of June.n Mongolia, summer vacation usually starts from late May or early June (varies between schools) to the end of August. The school year is divided into 4 terms lasting 8 to 9 weeks each and students take 1 week off after the first and second terms and 2 weeks after the third term.\n[7] Many resorts offer summer vacation packages that bundle accommodations, activities, and meals together. While these can seem convenient, it's important to carefully compare the total package cost to the cost of booking each element separately to ensure you're getting a good deal.\n[8] The Real Cost Of Summer Vacation: Don't Get Buried In Taxes While there are cost efficient vacations available – you can even staycation at home – it will cost you to pick up and go this summer. According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four. When you’re calculating the cost of your vacation, don’t be fooled by the proposed cost on hotel rooms and airfare. What is often missing from those figures as you book can be significant: taxes. Travel-related taxes can boost your travel cost by more than 50%.\n[9] One way to reduce the cost of summer vacation is to travel during the shoulder season, the period between peak and off-peak seasons. You can often find lower prices on flights and accommodations during these times.\n[10] Travel Travel, Veterans.

While specific top speed and acceleration figures vary by year and model, knowing it's a sports-oriented car suggests decent performance.\n[3] - The sports car's unladen weight is 1,390 kilograms and the power-to-weight ratio is 5.8 kg/bhp. Two-colour theme provides visual highlight. The Audi TT quattro sport is identifiable at first glance as a very special TT. The striking two-colour finish is the most immediate evidence that it is different.\n[4] Review: Renaultâs fastest ever car, the Clio RS16 We can’t tell you how quick this car actually is, though; it remains, officially, a concept, with no confirmed kerb weight. But if Renault Sport’s 1,200kg target has been met, then the RS16’s resulting 226bhp/tonne power-to-weight ratio should secure a 0-62mph time of around 5.5 seconds and a top speed north of 150mph.\n[5] Many factors influence the speed of a car, such as engine size, car weight, and aerodynamics. You would need to know the specific Renault Sport RS model and year to determine its speed, as these specifications change over time.\n[6] - Trying to find out which one is faster between the two is not rocket science. You have the Lamborghini Aventador, with its mid-mounted 690-horsepower engine, AWD, and a 7-speed single-clutch semi-automatic transmission.

I would advise to search for game shows filmed in unusual locations.\n[5] Alcatraz Island Alcatraz Island is located in San Francisco Bay, 1.25 miles offshore from San Francisco, California, United States. The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison, and a federal prison from 1934 until 1963. Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native activism across the nation, with public protests through the 1970s. In\n[6] San Francisco is a vibrant city with diverse neighborhoods, iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, and a thriving tech industry. Visitors can explore Fisherman's Wharf, enjoy the city's culinary scene, and experience its rich cultural history.\n[7] While there's no official record of a game show filmed inside Alcatraz prison itself, it's possible that a segment or challenge for a reality competition show might have been filmed there.
